        <!-- Detailed information about the impacts of bushfires -->
        Here we are considering the adverse effects of high intensity wildfires on the
        community and the environment. It should be remembered that it is not just intensity of
        a bushfire that matters. The extent of a bushfire is also very important. A large bushfire
        can cause multiple direct impacts: on life and property, on the survival of fauna
        populations, on water resources, and indirectly on government budgets and insurance
        costs. A large bushfire will also generate huge amounts of smoke.

          Community Impacts
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          In severe fire seasons the damage caused by bushfires is astronomical. In the 2003
          Canberra fire disaster, for example, the cost to insurers alone was $257 million (The
          West Australian, 13 Feb, 2003). The total cost of the fires, including the cost of
          suppression measures and lost productivity, would be much greater than this figure.
          Add to it the loss of life, personal trauma, loss of invaluable personal possessions and
          destruction of scientific equipment and data from the Mt Stromlo Observatory, and the
          ramifications of such disasters start to become apparent.
          <br><br>
          The community impacts from the 2009 Victorian disaster have been well documented
          in the media. An estimate of the final cost of this bushfire awaits the final report of the
          Royal Commission, but is likely to exceed a billion dollars.
          <br><br>
          And it does not end with the direct impacts of the fire on those affected. We all lose
          financially because the inevitable consequence of any large disaster is a rise in
          insurance premiums.
          <br><br>
          How much better then, if we can avoid, or at least minimise the risk, of such disasters
          happening again. While the Canberra fire disaster was a complex issue, with several
          factors contributing to the outcome, experienced fire managers have estimated that a
          prescribed burn costing about $100,000 would have prevented the disaster, but the burn
          did not take place due to mistaken land management policies. A mere $100,000 set
          against well over $257 million would seem a good deal for the community.
          <br><br>
          Canberra is not the only city to have suffered from bushfire damage in recent years.
          Sydney has experienced a series of lesser, but still serious, bushfire disasters since
          1994. In some respects most Australian city fringes and country towns have become
          more prone to bushfire damage over the past 30 or so years, with the proliferation of
          rural lifestyle smallholdings and natural vegetation reserves that are preserved, rather
          than actively managed. Many people who move into rural smallholdings have little
          awareness of bushfire issues and the threat posed by unmanaged native vegetation.

        <p>
          Firefighting is inherently a dangerous business, especially when confronted with a fire
          like that shown below. While good training can minimise the risks, under “blow up”
          conditions like that in Victoria in February 2009, even experienced firefighters are at very
          high risk.
          <br><br>
          We should not forget that most people fighting rural fires are volunteers, who take on
          these tasks out of a sense of community spirit. Why should we expose them to the
          huge risks entailed in fighting fires in heavy fuels. Don't we owe it to them to make their
          job as safe as we can? Fuel reduction burning is the only practical way to do that.

          Impacts on Forests
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Of course, the forests incinerated by these intense bushfires also suffer great damage.
          Unlike the usual description employed in the media, most native forests are not
          “destroyed” by wildfire. Some are. Ash-type eucalypt forests are killed in this way, as the
          1939 Victorian fire disaster clearly demonstrated. Drier forest types, such as jarrah in
          WA are not destroyed, although they are severely damaged and many trees are killed by
          high intensity bushfires.
          <br><br>
          Although some individual trees may die, the forest cover is not removed in a wildfire. In
          a large bushfire, however, the total number of trees killed can be very large. In the 2005
          Perth Hills fire, for example, it was estimated that over 1.5 million trees were killed
          outright. As the image above shows, the forest environment, so important for so many
          aspects of biodiversity, is completely lost for some time, until the trees are able to
          reform their crowns.
          <br><br>
          The bushfires caused extensive disruption to the natural processes that sustain forest ecosystems.
          The loss of vegetation and the alteration of soil composition disrupted the delicate balance of
          nutrient cycling, water retention, and carbon storage. This disruption has the potential to have
          long-term implications for the overall health and resilience of the forests, making them more
          vulnerable to future environmental stresses.
          <br><br>
          The natural regeneration of the forest is crucial for its recovery after a fire.
          However, the severity of the recent bushfires has altered the traditional regeneration
          patterns, making it more difficult for some plant species to reestablish themselves.
          The loss of seed banks and the alteration of germination cues can significantly hinder
          the recovery process, potentially leading to shifts in the composition and structure
          of the forest ecosystems over time.
          <br><br>
          The massive release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases during the bushfires
          contributed to a significant increase in atmospheric pollution. The heightened levels
          of carbon emissions further exacerbated the global climate crisis, contributing to the
          intensification of climate change and its associated impacts on ecosystems worldwide.

        <p>
          Intense bushfires cause the death, by incineration or smoke suffocation, of large
          numbers of native animals and insects that are unable to avoid the flames. Microsites
          (i.e. small areas of different nature from the general area) that do not burn under low
          intensity burns are incinerated and there are thus no refugial areas left for fire sensitive
          flora or fauna, or for subsequent recolonisation after the fire. Any animals that are able
          to take refuge in holes in the ground or in logs are usually quickly lost after a bushfire as
          they no longer have any cover from predators.
          <br><br>
          By contrast a mild fuel reduction burn causes very little damage. The usual objective is
          to burn only about 70% of an area, so that there is a patchwork of small areas unburnt in
          which insects and animals take refuge and from which later move out to recolonise the
          surrounding regenerating area. Unburnt plants in these patches also seed into adjacent
          areas. The fire also stimulates the germination of many species from seed stored in the
          soil. Other species of understorey plants regrow rapidly from rootstocks.
          <br><br>
          The bushfires posed a significant threat to several endangered and vulnerable species that
          were already struggling to maintain viable populations. Species such as the glossy black-cockatoo,
          the Kangaroo Island dunnart, and the long-footed potoroo were particularly susceptible to
          the immediate and long-term impacts of the fires, further jeopardizing their already fragile existence.
          <br><br>
          The loss of key wildlife species and their habitats due to the bushfires has disrupted the
          delicate ecological balance in various regions across Australia. The disappearance of certain
          species can have far-reaching consequences, affecting the dynamics of food chains, plant pollination,
          and ecosystem stability, ultimately leading to cascading effects on other wildlife and the
          environment as a whole.
          <br><br>
          Efforts to rehabilitate and restore the affected habitats, coupled with conservation initiatives
          aimed at protecting and preserving vulnerable wildlife populations, have been instrumental in
          mitigating some of the immediate impacts of the bushfires. Nevertheless, the recovery of Australia's
          wildlife and ecosystems remains an ongoing challenge, emphasizing the importance of sustained conservation
          efforts, habitat restoration, and comprehensive strategies to mitigate the impact of future
          catastrophic events.
