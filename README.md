## Self-reflection notes

In crafting my web programming assignment, I delved into the intricacies of design and functionality. Leveraging a split screen layout, I aimed to create a visually captivating experience for users. The utilization of dual JavaScript animations contributed significantly to the overall appeal. One animation facilitated the smooth transition of the content section upon scrolling, adding a dynamic touch to the user's journey through the page. The second animation was implemented to enhance user convenience by enabling the navigation bar to appear and disappear seamlessly while scrolling.

To establish a harmonious aesthetic, I centered my color palette around a soothing cream white, complemented by an alternative black shade. This deliberate choice was instrumental in maintaining a simple yet captivating website. I further integrated an engaging JavaScript animation where text letters gracefully dissipate like wisps of smoke upon user interaction, a feature that undoubtedly added an element of delight to the browsing experience. I encourage you to explore this feature firsthand, as it truly encapsulates the essence of the design concept.

Keeping in mind that legibility matters, I carefully chose common fonts from Google Fonts, thus allowing for an effortless and understandable read among the siteâ€™s visitors. All the font sizes were calculated for beauty and readability. In general, I am very satisfied to my results. I have shared my creation with my friends. They appreciated and admired me, reinforcing my confidence in the choice of design and implementation.

## Sources 

Throughout the development process of my web programming assignment, I prioritized the user experience, recognizing the importance of engaging visual elements. To achieve this, I sourced high-quality images primarily from Unsplash.com, ensuring that the website's imagery would captivate and resonate with users. (https://unsplash.com/)

In terms of content, I drew inspiration from the Bushfire Front website, recognizing the significance of their informative and relevant materials. (https://www.bushfirefront.org.au/home/fire-facts/impacts-of-bushfires/) Furthermore, my color choices were meticulously curated, with Google.com serving as a vital reference point. By leveraging insights from this platform, I was able to establish a cohesive and visually appealing color scheme that not only enhanced the overall aesthetic but also contributed to the seamless user experience. 

By leveraging resources such as Unsplash.com, the Bushfire Front website, and Google.com, I strived to create a holistic and engaging experience for users. Through the deliberate integration of these elements, I aimed to ensure that the website not only informed and engaged but also left a lasting impression on each visitor.

## What I would have improved 

While I am proud of the progress I made, there were some notable errors and areas where I believe I could improve in the future.

First and foremost, I realized that relying on libraries and doing further research is essential for creating a more professional and polished website. Incorporating established libraries and frameworks can help streamline development and ensure a higher level of quality and functionality. One of the aspects I noticed that needs improvement is the spacing within my website. Proper spacing and layout are critical for user readability and aesthetics.

I encountered a minor issue while attempting to implement a "read more/read less" button. Unfortunately, this feature caused disruptions in the layout of the page, affecting the overall user experience. As a result, I made the decision to exclude this feature from the final design. In hindsight, I should have spent more time troubleshooting and refining this functionality to ensure it didn't impact the layout negatively.

I am honestly excited to apply these lessons in my future web development projects, with the aim of creating more professional, visually appealing, and user-friendly websites.
